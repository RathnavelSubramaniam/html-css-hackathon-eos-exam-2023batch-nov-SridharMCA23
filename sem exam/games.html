    <P>In practical terms ‘sport’ is defined by its social interpretation as well as its strong association with physical exertion and performance measures. What we perceive as ‘sport’ in one instance may not be in another; sport takes on many forms and is constantly changing based upon societal norms, trends, and new directions.Sport participation is not easily defined and will often depend on how it is perceived by the observer. As a guide, a ‘sport participant’ is a person who takes part in a sporting activity, whether in a formal or informal capacity. Some examples of sport participation can be described by a particular role performed in sport (including playing and non-playing roles), such as an athlete (or player), coach (or trainer, instructor), or official (or umpire, referee). There are many roles in sport, and these can be volunteer or paid. How a person describes their engagement (such as solo or group, impromptu or scheduled, or the place/setting) can also help to determine if their sport participation is organised or not.</P>
